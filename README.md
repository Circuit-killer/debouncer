This debouncer repo contains the Verilog code for:

1. Debouncing buttons

2. Measuring the number of times a button bounces, and how long it takes to settle, and

3. All of these are tied together using a wishbone scope approach to measuring the result of any bounces.

It is a companion distribution to the button bouncing article series found on [zipcpu.com](http://zipcpu.com)
